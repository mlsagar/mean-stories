# mean-stories
Practice for Building MEAN Application
Using the provided database write a database-driven MEAN Stack application that performs the following tasks:
- Displays a list of stories. List the story title - container - topic (in any order). (5 points: 2 backend + 2 frontend + 1 hardening)
- By clicking on one of the stories from step 1 you get the details of that story. The details of a story are (title, container, topic, media, total number of comments, description, status, and name of the user that posted it). (5 points: 2 backend + 2 frontend + 1 hardening)
- On the page that displays the single story add the ability to switch popularity. When this button is clicked the story status changes to "un-popular". (2 points:: 1 backend + 1 frontend)
- Add the ability to go back from the page that displays the single story back to the page that displays the list of stories. (2 points)
- Make sure the name of your database is "meanStories" and the name of your collection is "stories", your backend can be started with "npm start", (1 point)

Make sure you cover all the points addressed in the course when writing your program. You may also solve this problem in any order you wish.

Note: Your database does have more data than your application needs, this is because the next set of features will be using that data.
